#This week I built an interactive schedule planner for an employee/end user with a busy schedule. 
#I implemented the moment.js library to display an acurate time and day for my user in the planner header.

#I created a button for saving planned events. I created a coressponding button to click to display the saved event once the page reloads. 

#I plan to go back and loop through all of the time blocks in order to apply the local storage application.
